Java offers two input methods, Scanner and BufferedReader.
Scanner simplifies console input for common use cases, providing easy-to-use methods for various data types.

BufferedReader, on the other hand, offers greater control and efficiency, making it suitable for complex input scenarios and handling large volumes of data, such as reading from files or network streams.

Getting input with library : import java.util.Scanner;
Getting Output with System.out.println();

Creating a BufferedReader Object : 

First create an InputStreamReader is = new InputStreamReader(System.in);
BufferedReader bf = new BufferedReader(is);
